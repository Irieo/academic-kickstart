abstract: "
Offshore wind energy development has been driven by government support schemes, but recent cost reductions raise the prospect of offshore wind becoming cheaper than conventional generation. Many countries use auctions to provide financial support, but differences in auction design make their results difficult to compare. Here we harmonise the auction results from five countries based on their design features, showing that offshore wind can be considered commercially competitive in mature markets. Between 2015 and 2019, the price paid for offshore wind across northern Europe has fallen by 11.9±1.6% per year. The bids received in 2019 translate to an average price of €51±3/MWh, and substantially different auction designs have received comparably low bids. The level of subsidy implied by auction results depends on future power prices, but projects in Germany and Netherlands are already subsidy-free, and it appears likely that in 2019 the UK has auctioned the world’s first negative-subsidy offshore wind farm."
